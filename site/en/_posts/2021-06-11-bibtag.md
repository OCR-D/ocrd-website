OCR-D will also be present at this year's Bibliothekartag, which will take place virtually from 16-18 June and on two
days in Bremen. The OCR-D project is participating with two presentations on the current status of the funding initiative
and on the collaborative creation of training materials. 


Elisabeth Engl](https://dbt2021.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/presentations/70) describes the current status of
the OCR-D software and gives an outlook on the many planned application scenarios, which are at the centre of the third
project phase. Kay-Michael WÃ¼rzner and Robert Sachunsky](https://dbt2021.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/presentations/184)
report on their experiences from a collaborative transcription initiative in which SLUB Dresden staff have been involved for a year.
