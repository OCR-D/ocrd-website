From October 7 to 8, the [eHumanities working group of the Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities](https://www.akademienunion.de/en/working-groups/working-group-on-ehumanities/),
in cooperation with the [GÃ¶ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities](https://adw-goe.de/en/home/),
is organizing the workshop *FAIR & Co: Visibility and Availability of Digital Academy Research in a Networked Scientific Landscape*.
The OCR-D project will be represented with a lecture on the topic *Digital Transformation: OCR-D, Offer and Vision* by Matthias Boenig (BBAW).
Using the example of the German Text Archive, it will be shown how the application spectrum of this reference
corpus can be extended by the area of machine learning to improve character and structure
recognition. For the whole program of the workshop see the [website of this workshop](https://workshop.adw-goe.de/programm/).
