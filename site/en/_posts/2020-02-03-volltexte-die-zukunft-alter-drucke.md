The OCR-D workshop "Full texts - the future of old prints" will take place in Bonn on 12 February. The findings and desiderata of the DFG project will be presented and discussed there with a broad audience of developers, OCR experts, users and funding agencies. 

The first morning lectures will focus on the OCR-D software itself. It will be demonstrated with its range of functions and technical possibilities, specifications and documentation will be described as a basis for its creation and use. The experiences and insights that the software developers have gained on the creation of OCR in libraries are of special interest with regard to future OCR projects. The morning section will be concluded in a panel discussion with the developers of the OCR-D module projects.

The afternoon section is reserved for the discussion about the future of the OCR-D software. The workshop participants will discuss various ways and possibilities for implementing the software at libraries and transferring it to practical use. Subsequently, possible further funding measures of the DFG project will be discussed, with the help of which the last steps can be taken towards the mass processing of the VD titles, which is ultimately targeted.
