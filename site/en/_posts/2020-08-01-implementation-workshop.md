Following the successful first (virtual) meeting of those interested in the DFG-call for the
implementation of the OCR-D-Software, a further workshop will be held on **7 August, 9-13 p.m.**
to prepare the OCR-D grant proposals. 

At this second meeting the applicants can inform each other about their previous tests of
the OCR-D software and exchange experiences. In addition, the project plans,
which have been further developed in the meantime, will be discussed in order to identify
possible synergies between the grant proposals.

We are looking forward to this new exchange and a continuing successful pilot phase!
