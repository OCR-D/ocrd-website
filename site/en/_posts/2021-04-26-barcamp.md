On 7 May 2021 will be the inaugural session of our new barcamp-like montly event **OCR(-D) & Co**. 
barcamp format, developers, users and all other interested persons will be will be given the opportunity to talk
about OCR(-D).

OCR(-D) & Co will take place every first Friday of the month from May onwards at 10-11 am in a [BBB room](https://meet.gwdg.de/b/kon-v6q-azq-3el).
At the beginning of each meeting, participants have the opportunity to suggest topics of interest, which can then
be discussed and debated in small groups. In addition to the [open TechCall](https://hackmd.io/OOMgg3ZeSqK4vfKL1wRbwQ?view),
where the OCR-D community discusses technical topics every second Wednesday, OCR(-D) & Co also offers participants without in-depth
OCR-D knowledge the opportunity to contribute their own questions and ideas to the discussion and to openly exchange ideas
with other OCR-interested people. We look forward to your participation!
