From October 7 to 8, the eHumanities working group of the Union of German Academies of
Sciences and Humanities, in cooperation with the Academy of Sciences and Humanities in
GÃ¶ttingen, is organizing the workshop *FAIR & Co: Visibility and Availability of Digital Academy Research in a Networked Scientific Landscape*.
The OCR-D project will be represented with a lecture by Matthias Boenig. 

Using the example of DTA, it will be shown how the application spectrum of this reference
corpus can be extended by the area of machine learning to improve character and structure
recognition. For the whole program of the workshop see the [website of this workshop](https://workshop.adw-goe.de/programm/).
