The coordination project's application for the third phase of the OCR-D funding initiative was approved by the DFG.
In phase III, the results of the previous MP phase will be stabilised and the productive use of the
OCR-D software in mass digitisation will be initiated technically and organisationally.


The previous project partners from BBAW, HAB and SBB will now be joined by SUB GÃ¶ttingen and GWDG. 
Together, the partners can continue to support and coordinate the work of the other OCR-D projects in Phase III.
In addition, the OCR-D software will be optimised for its use in mass digitisation and the functioning of the
overall OCR-D workflow will be ensured. Great importance will be put on ensuring the permanent support and
further development of the OCR-D software and on communicating the results of the implementation work to a
broad circle of users who will use it for the efficient full-text digitisation of VD materials.

The coordination project is delighted about the opportunity to continue the work of the two previous project
phases and looks forward to working with the other OCR-D projects.
