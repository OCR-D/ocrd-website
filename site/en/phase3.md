# OCR-D - Phase III

In February 2020, the DFG published a call for proposals to continue the OCR-D project in [a third project phase](https://ocr-d.de/en/2020/02/25/dfg-call.html). 
The goal of this phase is the implementation of the OCR-D software in institutions that 
maintain and process collections. Four implementation and three module projects were approved by the DFG. 

On 30 July, our kick-off workshop took place, heralding phase III of OCR-D. The team of the Coordination Project introduced [objectives and communications channels of phase III](https://ocr-d.de/assets/kick-off/phase3.pdf), gave an insight into the current [status and plans of the OCR-D software](https://ocr-d.de/assets/kick-off/spec_core_ocrd_all.pdf), the [Web API](https://ocr-d.de/assets/kick-off/web-api.pdf) and the handling of [Ground Truth Data in OCR-D](https://ocr-d.de/assets/kick-off/gt.pdf). Furthermore, the Coordination Project presented Best Practices of [Software Developing in OCR-D](https://ocr-d.de/assets/kick-off/software-development.pdf), including ideas for the community on how to contribute. 
In addition, the [implementation and module projects presented themselves](https://ocr-d.de/assets/kick-off/lightning-talks.pdf) to the interested community and to our [cooperation partners](https://ocr-d.de/en/contact#cooperation-partners).
