# OCR-D Research Data Repository
The OCR-D research data repository collects all versions of documents and (intermediate) results created during the document analysis. It contains at least the end results of every processed document. During the ingest much metadata about the document will be extracted and made available for search/filter (e.g. identifier(s), title, classification(s), genre(s), semantic label(s), used processor(s), text). In future, there may also be export options for specific tools.

# OCR-D Ground Truth Repository
Similarly, there is a publicly available OCR-D repository, which contains all ground truth data provided by OCR-D. 
* For further information about the metadata format, see https://github.com/OCR-D/gt-labelling
* The repository itself is available at https://ocr-d-repo.scc.kit.edu/api/v1/metastore/bagit/search
