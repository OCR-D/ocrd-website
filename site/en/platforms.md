# OCR-D Platforms

In OCR-D, we strive for maximum transparency and communication of our work
internally as well as externally. The project is active on various platforms,
which are mostly open to the professional public to read and participate.

**GitHub** – try it out yourself: On GitHub you can find the latest status of our developmental work on the OCR-D framework and the module projects.

**Gitter** – follow up on our discussions: We use the chat platform Gitter for short-term and low-threshold communication with each other.

**Ground Truth Repository** – make use of our data. We collect our test and reference data in the Ground Truth Repository. You may use the data for your own training.
