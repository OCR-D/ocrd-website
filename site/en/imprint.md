## Disclaimer

### Content of the Online Offer

The author assumes no liability for the topicality, correctness, completeness
or quality of the information provided. Liability claims against the author
relating to material or immaterial damage caused by the use or non-use of the
information provided or by the use of incorrect or incomplete information are
excluded, unless there is evidence of willful intent or gross negligence on the
part of the author.

All offers are subject to change and non-binding. The author expressly reserves
the right to change, supplement or delete parts of the pages or the entire
offer without prior notice or to discontinue publication temporarily or
permanently.

### References and Links

The author is not responsible for any contents linked or referred to from his
pages – unless he has full knowledge of illegal contents and would technically
be able to prevent the visitors of his site from viewing those pages.

The author hereby expressly declares that at the time the links were created,
no illegal content was recognizable on the linked pages. The author has no
influence whatsoever on the current and future design, content or authorship of
the linked pages. The author therefore expressly distances himself from all
contents of all linked pages that have been changed since the link was created.
This statement applies to all links and references set within the author's own
Internet offer as well as to third-party entries in guest books, discussion
forums and mailing lists set up by the author. For illegal, incorrect or
incomplete contents and in particular for damages arising from the use or
non-use of such information, the provider of the page to which reference is
made is solely liable, not the party who merely refers to the respective
publication via links.

**Copyright and Trademark Law

The author endeavours to observe the copyrights of the graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts used in all publications, to use graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts created by himself or to make use of licence-free graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts.
All brands and trademarks mentioned within the Internet offer and possibly protected by third parties are subject without restriction to the provisions of the applicable trademark law and the ownership rights of the respective registered owners. The mere fact that a trademark is mentioned should not lead to the conclusion that it is not protected by the rights of third parties!
The copyright for published objects created by the author himself remains solely with the author of the pages. Any duplication or use of objects such as diagrams, sounds or texts in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the author's agreement.

**Data Protection**

As part of its participation in the German Library Statistics, the Herzog
August Bibliothek uses a procedure for counting visits to its website. When
calling up the homepage and/or the catalogue page ("OPAC"), an identifier of
the library and the page concerned, the time of the call and a signature of the
calling computer are stored. The signature is generated using a one-way
function consisting of IP address, browser identification and proxy
information. The collection, storage and evaluation of this data takes place in
pseudoanonymised form, i.e. the signature cannot be assigned to specific
persons. The IP address in particular is not stored. The pseudonymous
individual data are summed up after 24 hours at the latest and thus anonymised.

The stored data is statistically evaluated in order to design and further
develop our website in line with requirements. The data will only be used for
this purpose and will be deleted after evaluation.

The Stuttgart Media University is responsible for the technical and
organisational implementation of the procedure. It has developed the procedure
in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act and the Telemedia
Act (TMG) and undertakes to comply with them.

You have the opportunity to object to the collection, processing and use of the
aforementioned data of your visits for the aforementioned purpose. Please click
on the following external
[Link](http://dbspixel.hbz-nrw.de/widerspruch.html).

If the opportunity for the input of personal or business data (email addresses,
name, addresses) is given, the input of these data takes place voluntarily. The
use and payment of all offered services are permitted – if and so far
technically possible and reasonable – without specification of any personal
data or under specification of anonymized data or an alias.

### Legal Validity of this Disclaime

This disclaimer is to be regarded as part of the internet publication which you
were referred from. If sections or individual terms of this statement are not
legal or correct, the content or validity of the other parts remain
uninfluenced by this fact.
