# Decisions in OCR-D

In a software project, especially a highly distributed one like OCR-D,
decisions need to be made on the technology used, how interfaces should
interoperate and how the software as a whole is designed.

In this document, such decisions on key aspects of OCR-D are discussed for the
benefit of all OCR-D stakeholders.

## Terminology

* *current* refers to **August 1, 2024**, the last change of this document
* *Q1-Q4* refers to yearly quarters
* *target version* is the version we mainly test and develop for
* *supported version* means that we test this version and ensure compatibility

## General decisions

* [x] [Q2 2023] We will update to Ubuntu 22.04 and Python 3.8 as soon as possible. [OCR-D/core#956](https://github.com/OCR-D/core/pull/956)
* [ ] [Q3 2024] Switch to Slim Containers in `ocrd_all`
* [ ] [Q3 2024] Python API changes (Pagewise processing) [OCR-D/core#322](https://github.com/OCR-D/core/issues/322)

## Workflow format

* [ ] [Q3 2024] We use `ocrd process`, a simplified shell syntax.

## Web API

* [x] [Q3 2023] Switch to the new architecture with message queue.
  * Processing Broker and Processing Server will be provided via OCR-D Core.
* [x] [2022] OCR-D Coordination Project provides the [Web API spec](web_api) and [implementation](https://github.com/OCR-D/core/tree/master/src/ocrd_network).

## QUIVER

* [x] [2022] We will create a web application, [QUIVER](https://github.com/OCR-D/quiver-back-end) (for QUalIty oVERview), in
  which some information about OCR-D processors are provided:
  * a general overview of the projects (i.e. GitHub repositories), e.g. if their `ocrd-tool.json` is valid, when their last release has been made etc.
  * a workflow section where we [benchmark](#benchmarking) different workflows for different corpora.
  * a general overview of the available processors

### Benchmarking

* [x] [2022] To execute the benchmarking, we will create several corpora with different characteristics (font, creation date, layout, â€¦) and 
run different workflows with these as input. The result is then displayed in the QUIVER workflow tab.
The corpora will be publicly available for better transparency.
* [2022] [Relevant metrics](https://github.com/OCR-D/spec/pull/225) for the minimum viable product (MVP) will be:
  * CER
  * WER
  * Bag of Words
  * Reading order
  * IoU
  * CPU time
  * wall time
  * I/O
  * Memory Usage
  * Disc usage
* [x] [2022] The benchmarking will be executed automatically in a regular interval to measure if changes in the processors improve the result.
This might be done via CI, GitHub Actions or as a CRON job on a separate server.

## OCR-D/core

### METS server

* [x] The current approach to file management requires processors accessing a single METS file on disk, which turns file management into a bottleneck for workflows. To alleviate this, we [will develop an HTTP server](https://github.com/OCR-D/core/pull/966) that provides asynchronous and parallel access to the METS in **Q4 2022**.

### Decentralized resource list

* We currently maintain a list of processor resources centrally in OCR-D/core.
* [x] In **Q3 2022**, to allow processor developers to maintain their own separate list of resources, we have implemented mechanisms to store resource lists in a processor's `ocrd-tool.json` and bundle resources in their own module directory.
* [x] By **Q1 2023** we should have updated all the processors and whittled down the central list to a mostly empty list.

### Page-wise processing

* Currently, processors iterate through the files of a workspace by looping through all the files in the input file group(s) themselves.
* [ ] In **Q3 2024** we will refactor the processor API, deprecate the current
approach of processors iterating in a `process` method and enable processors
to process individual pages in a `process_page` method.

## ocrd_all Docker deployment

* Our current target container is a **fat container**, with **maximum**,
  **medium** and **minimum** versions with decreasing amount of processors
  contained.
* We will wrap processor projects individually and transition to **slim containers** in **Q3 2024**.

## Supported Python versions

* [ ] Our current target version for Python is **3.8**, 3.9 - 3.10 are fully supported, 3.11 and 3.12 partially (not all libraries of all processors supported, but core is).
* [x] Support for **3.6** will end **Q4 2022**. We will not test and include Python 3.6 after that.
* [x] We will start to support **3.11** in **Q1 2023**.
* [x] We will start to support **3.12** in **Q2 2023** (:warning: won't have distutils anymore)
* [x] Support for **3.7** will end **Q2 2023**.
* [ ] Support for **3.8** will end **Q4 2024**.
* [ ] Support for **3.9** will end **Q1 2025**.

## Base OS image

* [ ] Our current base image for deployment is **Ubuntu 20.04**, we support **Ubuntu 18.04**, **20.04** and **22.04**.
* [x] We will change the base image to **Ubuntu 20.04** in **Q4 2022**.
* [ ] We will change the base image to **Ubuntu 22.04** in **Q4 2024**.
* [x] Support for **Ubuntu 18.04** will end in **Q1 2023**.
* [ ] Support for **Ubuntu 20.04** will end in **Q1 2025**.

## Software libraries

### [calamari](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd_calamari)

* Our currently supported calamari version is **1.x**.
* We will switch to **2.x** in **Q1 2023**.

* Support for **1.x** will end in **Q1 2022**

### [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)

* We currently support Pillow **5.x** to **v10.x**

### [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

* Our target version is **2.5.0**
* We currently support **1.15.x**, **2.4.0** and **2.5.0**. While we strongly
  encourage moving away from **1.15.x**, due to the logistics of updating
  trained models, we don't have a fixed cut-off date. However, since tf1 is not
  supported by python < 3.8, we will only provide Docker images and not support
  native installation anymore from Q4 2024.

### [torch](https://pytorch.org/)

* Our current target version is **1.10.x**.

### bash

* We use bash scripting for development tasks and for the bashlib library in OCR-D.
* Our current target version is **4.4**.
