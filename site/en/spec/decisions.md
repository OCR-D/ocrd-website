# Decisions in OCR-D

In a software project, especially a highly distributed one like OCR-D,
decisions need to be made on the technology used, how interfaces should
interoperate and how the software as a whole is designed.

In this document, such decisions on key aspects of OCR-D are discussed for the
benefit of all OCR-D stakeholders.

## Terminology

* *current* refers to **December 13, 2022**, the last change of this document
* *Q1-Q4* refers to yearly quarters
* *target version* is the version we mainly test and develop for
* *supported version* means that we test this version and ensure compatibility

## General decisions

* [Q1 2023] We will update to Ubuntu 22.04 and Python 3.7 as soon as possible. [OCR-D/core#956](https://github.com/OCR-D/core/pull/956)
* [Q1 2023] Switch to Slim Containers in `ocrd_all`
* [Q1 2023] Python API changes (Pagewise processing) [OCR-D/core#322](https://github.com/OCR-D/core/issues/322)

## Workflow format

* [Q3 2022] We use Nextflow. The whole `.nf` file (Nextflow file) as the workflow
  format workflow server and processing 
  server including [web API implementation](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd-webapi-implementation) is part of the
  [implementation projects](phase3). Further details can be found [in the nextflow spec](nextflow).

## Web API

* [Q3 2022] Switch to the new architecture with message queue.
  * Processing Broker and Processing Server will be provided via OCR-D Core.
* [2022] OCR-D Coordination Project provides the [Web API spec](web_api). Only
  the [REST API wrapper](https://github.com/OCR-D/core/pull/884) of a single processor is provided by OCR-D Core.

## QUIVER

* [2022] We will create a web application, [QUIVER](https://github.com/OCR-D/quiver-back-end) (for QUalIty oVERview), in
  which some information about OCR-D processors are provided:
  * a general overview of the projects (i.e. GitHub repositories), e.g. if their `ocrd-tool.json` is valid, when their last release has been made etc.
  * a workflow section where we [benchmark](#benchmarking) different workflows for different corpora.
  * a general overview of the available processors

### Benchmarking

* [2022] To execute the benchmarking, we will create several corpora with different characteristics (font, creation date, layout, â€¦) and 
run different workflows with these as input. The result is then displayed in the QUIVER workflow tab.
The corpora will be publicly available for better transparency.
* [2022] [Relevant metrics](https://github.com/OCR-D/spec/pull/225) for the mininum viable product (MVP) will be:
  * CER
  * WER
  * Bag of Words
  * Reading order
  * IoU
  * CPU time
  * wall time
  * I/O
  * Memory Usage
  * Disc usage
* [2022] The benchmarking will be executed automatically in a regular interval to measure if changes in the processors improve the result.
This might be done via CI, GitHub Actions or as a CRON job on a separate server.

## OCR-D/core

### METS server

The current approach to file management requires processors accessing a single
METS file on disk, which turns file management into a bottleneck for workflows.

To alleviate this, we [will develop an HTTP server](https://github.com/OCR-D/core/pull/966) that provides asynchronous and
parallel access to the METS in **Q4 2022**.

### Decentralized resource list

We currently maintain a list of processor resources centrally in OCR-D/core.

In **Q3 2022**, to allow processor developers to maintain their own separate
list of resources, we have implemented mechanisms to store resource lists in a
processor's `ocrd-tool.json` and bundle resources in their own module directory.

By **Q1 2023** we should have updated all the processors and whittled down the
central list to a mostly empty list.

### Page-wise processing

Currently, processors iterate through the files of a workspace by looping through
all the files in the input file group(s) themselves.

In **Q1 2023** we will refactor the processor API, deprecate the current
approach of processors iterating in a `process` method and enable processors
to process individual pages in a `process_page` method.

<!--
   -## Processors
   -
   -In this section we outline our plans with the various processor projects.
   -
   -**NOTE** Currently only anybaseocr as an example
   -
   -### [ocrd_anybaseocr](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd_anybaseocr)
   -
   -`ocrd_anybaseocr` is a fairly complex project with multiple processors working
   -on different problems with different technologies. Some processors are
   -powerful, some are too experimental to be recommended. The original developers
   -have moved on from the projects, so it is essential for maintainability by the
   -community that we refactor it.
   -->

## ocrd_all Docker deployment


* Our current target container is a **fat container**, with **maximum**,
  **medium** and **minimum** versions with decreasing amount of processors
  contained.
* We will wrap processor projects individually and transition to **slim containers** in **Q1 2023**.

## Supported Python versions


* Our current target version for Python is **3.7**, we support **3.6** and **3.7** fully, later versions partially.
* :warning: We cannot currently upgrade beyond **3.7** because there are no [tensorflow v1.15.x](#tensorflow) prebuilt images available. We need to investigate how to alleviate this until **Q4 2022**.
* We will change the target version for Python to **3.10** in **Q1 2023** when we have solved the tensorflow problem.
* Support for **3.6** will end **Q4 2022**. We will not test and include Python 3.6 after that.
* We will start to support **3.11** in **Q1 2023**.
* We will start to support **3.12** in **Q2 2023** (:warning: won't have distutils anymore)
* Support for **3.7** will end **Q2 2023**.
* Support for **3.8** will end **Q3 2023**.
* Support for **3.9** will end **Q4 2023**.

## Base OS image

* Our current base image for deployment is **Ubuntu 18.04**, we support **Ubuntu 18.04**, **20.04** and **22.04**.
* We will change the base image to **Ubuntu 20.04** in **Q4 2022**.
* We will change the base image to **Ubuntu 22.04** in **Q1 2023**.
* Support for **Ubuntu 18.04** will end in **Q1 2023**.
* Support for **Ubuntu 20.04** will end in **Q2 2024**.

## Software libraries

### [calamari](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd_calamari)

* Our currently supported calamari version is **1.x**.
* We will switch to **2.x** in **Q1 2023**.

* Support for **1.x** will end in **Q1 2022**

### [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)

* We currently support Pillow **5.x** to **v9.x**

### [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

* Our target version is **2.5.0**
* We currently support **1.15.x**, **2.4.0** and **2.5.0**.
  While we strongly encourage moving away from **1.15.x**, due to the
  logistics of updating trained models, we don't have a fixed
  cut-off date.

### [torch](https://pytorch.org/)

* Our current target version is **1.10.x**.

### bash

* We use bash scripting for development tasks and for the bashlib library in OCR-D.
* Our current target version is **4.4**.
