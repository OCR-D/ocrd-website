                  illegal activity. Obligations for the removal or blocking of the use of information
                  according to the general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this respect
                  is only
                  possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. If we become aware
                  of any

                  a

                  transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication via E-Mail) can have security gaps.
                  A
