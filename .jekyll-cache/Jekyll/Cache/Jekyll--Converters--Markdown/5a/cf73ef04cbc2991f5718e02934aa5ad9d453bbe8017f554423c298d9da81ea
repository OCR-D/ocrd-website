I"O<p>We are very happy about the <a href="https://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/foerderung/programme/lis/absichtserklaerungen_ocrd_2020/ocrd_absichtserklaerungen_liste.pdf">great interest in the DFG call for proposals for the implementation of the OCR-D software</a>. As OCR-D coordination project
we will support the planned projects from the pilot phase onwards and promote the exchange of information among interested parties as desired by the DFG.
To kick off the pilot phase, we are organising a large <strong>video conference</strong> on <strong>19 June, 9-13 oâ€™clock</strong>, at which all interested parties can get to know 
each other and the pilot tests can be coordinated.</p>

<p>Interested parties who have not submitted a letter of intent themselves and who are still looking for a suitable partner with whom 
they could engage in the third phase of OCR-D are also welcome to the video conference.</p>

<p>If you are interested, please register for the video conference <strong>by 12 June</strong> at engl@hab.de.</p>

<p>We look forward to working with you and to a successful pilot phase!</p>
