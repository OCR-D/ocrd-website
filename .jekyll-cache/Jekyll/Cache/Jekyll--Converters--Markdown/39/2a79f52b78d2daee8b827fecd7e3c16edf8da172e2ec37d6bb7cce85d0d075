I"‚<p>In addition to the coordination project, the DFG also approved seven implementation 
and module projects that will begin their work in the coming months.</p>

<p>Of the eleven proposals submitted, which were developed in the course of extensive piloting 
of the OCR-D software in the summer of 2020, four implementation and three module projects 
will be funded by the DFG.</p>

<p>The module projects will further develop selected OCR-D tools.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Workflow for work-specific training based on generic models with OCR-D as well as ground truth enhancement (UB Mannheim).</li>
  <li>Font Group Recognition for Improved OCR (JGU Mainz, FAU Erlangen)</li>
  <li>OLA-HD Service - A Generic Service for Long-Term Archiving of Historical Prints (SUB GÃ¶ttingen, GWDG)</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with the ca. 65 other OCR-D tools,  these form the basis for the work of the four implementation projects, which will prepare the existing OCR-D software for its productive use in mass digitisation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integration of Kitodo and OCR-D for productive mass digitisation (UB Braunschweig, SLUB Dresden, UB Mannheim).</li>
  <li>OPERANDI: OCR-D Performance Optimisation and Integration (SUB GÃ¶ttingen, GWDG)</li>
  <li>OCR-D Software in Modular Mass Digitisation Workflows (ULB Halle)</li>
  <li>OCR4all libraries full text recognition of historical collections (GEI Braunschweig, HCI and ZPD of the University of WÃ¼rzburg)</li>
</ul>

<p>We are very much looking forward to this next project phase and the (further) cooperation with the implementation and module projects, which will prepare the use of the OCR-D software in different usage scenarios.</p>
