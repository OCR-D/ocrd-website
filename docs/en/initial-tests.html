        <h1 id="results-and-findings-of-the-first-ocr-d-test">Results and findings of the first OCR-D test</h1>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>At the turn of the year 2019/2020, the OCR-D software was tested for the first
time in nine pilot libraries. This was to ensure the practical acceptance of
the software by future, potential users. Therefore the focus was on its
functionality and usability in practice. In addition to the partners of the
coordination project, two libraries involved in the module projects as well as
four other libraries took part in the testing. The findings of this first test
run will be incorporated into the further development of the OCR-D prototype.</p>

<p>All pilot libraries have some know-how and experience with OCR, as they have
already produced full texts at least on project level or via commercial service
providers. The extent to which OCR, which is regarded as important, should be
carried out in-house in future and firmly anchored in the digitisation
workflow, is currently discussed in the libraries. Concerning the target groups
of the full texts there are different opinions in the testing institutions.
While one third name humanities scholars in general, another third would like
to serve a very broad target group (humanities, digital humanities, computer
linguistics and economics). The remaining libraries only see relatively few,
specialised users (Digital Humanities or Computational Linguistics) as the
target group for OCR texts.</p>

<p>The pilot libraries demand the following features of an OCR software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High recognition rate of layout and text</li>
  <li>Cost-effective use</li>
  <li>Quick adaptability/troubleshooting</li>
  <li>Modularity</li>
  <li>Output in standard formats</li>
  <li>Connection to existing workflows</li>
  <li>Well-documented interfaces</li>
  <li>Word coordinates</li>
  <li>Trainability</li>
  <li>Extensive GT corpora</li>
</ul>

<p>High quality of text recognition is most important, whereas the other
characteristics are only named each by some of the pilot libraries and should
be considered as desired but subordinate optional features.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-of-the-software-tests">Evaluation of the software tests</h2>

<p>In order to ensure the comparability of the individual tests in the pilot
libraries, a questionnaire distributed to the pilot libraries at the beginning
of the test. In this questionnaire, the general conditions of the test run,
e.g. the technical equipment used and the tested OCR-D processors, as well as
the documentation of the software, interfaces, functionality and usability of
the software, its possibilities for being integrated into existing workflows
and the required output formats are recorded. Furthermore, recognition quality,
functionality and usability, open requirements and positive features of the
OCR-D software as well as the results of the test were to be described.</p>

<p>During the test phase, the various options for installing the OCR-D software
with and without a Docker container were tried out and the software was
successfully installed on a wide range of servers with varying processing
power, some of them virtual. For Non-Intel CPU architectures (ARM, PowerPC64)
this was more complicated and time consuming, as individual Python packages
were not packaged for these computers and had to be adapted manually. The
complete installation of all available OCR-D processors (<code class="highlighter-rouge">ocrd_all</code>), which was
developed during the test phase, was confirmed as the least complex variant and
was therefore the most recommendable. No pilot library integrated the OCR-D
software In a workflow software such as Kitodo, as this would have meant too
much work for a simple test run.</p>

<p>The usage of the numerous OCR-D processors was described as a challenge.
Calling the processors was not so much of a problem than understanding their
respective areas of application and, in particular, selecting and combining the
processors to form meaningful workflows. For the first test, besides the
technical documentation of the software, there was no overall documentation on
its use available yet, which is also aimed at users inexperienced in OCR. The
requirements and wishes of the testers for such a documentation were taken into
account when preparing the manuals, which are now available <a href="https://ocr-d.de/en/use">in the user area
of the OCR-D website</a> and will be improved
continuously.</p>

<p>The OCR-D software runs very stable, no library reported any crashes. All of
the required output formats are already provided, whereas requested changes on
OCR-D’s interfaces are already planned for the further development of the
prototype.</p>

<p>The recognition quality was only checked on individual pages by the respective
pilot libraries, as there is no Ground Truth available for the test books.
Overall, the results of this first test run are promising. The Mannheim
University Library has tested OCR-D with a focus on Tesseract processors on
five prints from the 16th to 19th century. On antiqua prints from the 17th and
18th centuries and a blackletter (Fraktur) text from the 19th century, as
expected, the best results of - in the case of the antiqua - significantly less
than 0.1 CER were achieved for the raw data, whereas the blackletter prints
from the 17th century was slightly above 0.1 CER. The greatest challenge was
the 16th century blackletter, where only a CER of just under 0.16 was reached.
The BBAW provides a comprehensive insight into their testing, by making their
<a href="https://github.com/tboenig/ocrd_bbaw_pilotbibliothek">report and data publicly
available</a>.</p>

<p>The OCR-D testers formulate some desiderata especially with regard to
documentation, quality and usability of the processors as well as their future
scalability. The requirements for the documentation of the OCR-D software have
already been implemented to a large extent, though documentation as a whole is
regarded as a continuous task which must successively include above all
practical experience in the application of the OCR-D software. For the
processors, some improvements would still be desirable, especially in layout
recognition and post-correction. The corresponding developments of the OCR-D
module projects could only be tested to a limited extent due to their
development stage or their special technical requirements (GPU). Hopefully, the
above mentioned desiderata can be met with their results or with further
models. For the use of the OCR-D software in mass digitisation, the runtime of
several processors - as originally planned for the third project phase - still
needs to be optimised, and the possibilities for parallelisation should also be
expanded.</p>

<p>The testers positively emphasized the modular and transparent structure of the
OCR-D software, which distinguishes it in particular from other OCR solutions
and allows the its users to configure optimal workflows for particular use
cases. Furthermore, all OCR-D source code is freely available and can be
further developed by experts specialized in their respective fields and can be
adapted in-house for usage in experiments on the OCR workflow without extensive
programming work. In case of questions and problems, the developers quickly
provide low-threshold support. All in all, it is comparatively easy to initiate
the robustly running OCR-D full-text generation process, which is still in need
of further optimization but already delivers promising results.</p>
